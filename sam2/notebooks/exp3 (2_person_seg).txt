In the implementation section of my report, I detailed the process of identifying occluded frames for a specific person in a segmented video. After successfully segmenting the objects of interest (three persons) in the video, I focused on calculating the occluded frames for one of the segmented persons. To achieve this, I utilized the mask density method.

The mask density is calculated by dividing the sum of the mask's pixel values by the total number of pixels in the mask. This density value provides an indication of how much of the segmented object is visible in each frame. By setting a threshold for the mask density, I was able to determine which frames had a density below this threshold, indicating that the object was occluded.

I iterated through each frame of the video, calculated the mask density for the specific person of interest, and identified frames where the density was below the set threshold. These frames were then marked as occluded. This approach allowed me to systematically and efficiently identify occluded frames based on the visibility of the segmented object.

In the context of image processing and segmentation, the density of a mask refers to the proportion of pixels within the mask that are marked as part of the object of interest. It is a measure of how much of the mask area is occupied by the object.

Here's a brief explanation:

Mask: A binary image where pixels belonging to the object are marked with a value (typically 1), and background pixels are marked with another value (typically 0).

Density Calculation:

Sum of Mask Pixels: Count the number of pixels in the mask that are marked as part of the object (value 1).
Total Number of Pixels: Calculate the total number of pixels in the mask (width * height of the mask).
Density: The density is the ratio of the sum of mask pixels to the total number of pixels. It is calculated as: [ \text{Density} = \frac{\text{Sum of Mask Pixels}}{\text{Total Number of Pixels}} ]
Interpretation:

A higher density value indicates that a larger portion of the mask is occupied by the object.
A lower density value indicates that a smaller portion of the mask is occupied by the object, which might suggest occlusion or partial visibility.
In summary, density provides a quantitative measure of how much of the mask area is covered by the object, which can be useful for identifying frames where the object is occluded or partially visible.
