Pixel Intensity Distribution Analysis is an alternative method to calculate occluded frames by examining the distribution of non-zero pixel intensities within the mask. This approach starts by extracting the mask from each video segment and converting it into a NumPy array. The indices of non-zero pixels are identified using np.argwhere(mask > 0). Once the non-zero pixels are identified, the method calculates key distribution metrics such as the mean and standard deviation of the pixel intensities. Additionally, a histogram of the pixel intensities can be generated to visualize the distribution.

Frames are considered occluded if the mean intensity is very low or if the standard deviation is very small, indicating a lack of significant features within the mask. Furthermore, a sparse or highly concentrated histogram can also suggest occlusion, as it implies that the pixel intensities are not well-distributed. This statistical approach provides a more nuanced understanding of the pixel intensity distribution, allowing for the identification of occluded frames based on the characteristics of the pixel intensities rather than just their spatial spread.

In the provided code, the method used to calculate the occluded frames involves analyzing the spread of non-zero pixels in the mask of each video segment. Here are the steps in detail:

Extract the Mask: For each video segment, the mask is extracted and converted to a NumPy array of unsigned integers.

Identify Non-Zero Pixels: The indices of non-zero pixels in the mask are identified using np.argwhere(mask > 0). These non-zero pixels represent the areas of interest in the mask.

Calculate Spread: The spread of the non-zero pixels is calculated by finding the range of their coordinates:

y_coords and x_coords are the y and x coordinates of the non-zero pixels, respectively.
y_range is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum y coordinates.
x_range is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum x coordinates.
Determine Occlusion: A frame is considered occluded if:

The spread of non-zero pixels is too small (i.e., y_range < 10 or x_range < 10), indicating that the area of interest is too small to be significant.
The mask is empty (i.e., there are no non-zero pixels), indicating full occlusion.
Store Occluded Frames: If a frame is determined to be occluded, it is added to the occluded_frames list along with its index and mask.

Visualization: The occluded frames are then plotted in a grid for visualization.

This method effectively identifies frames where the area of interest is either too small or completely absent, which are considered occluded frames.
